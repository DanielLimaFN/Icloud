# You need to have Python installed on your machine in order for this script to work !
# This script downloads all media ( photos & videos ) from your iCloud and saves them in a "Phone Media" directory on your desktop, then deletes them from iCloud so you can save more iCloud space.
# The photo and video quality are the same as they were on your phone.
# If the file has been already been downloaded ( I know it should have been deleted first so this shouldn't happen, but maybe you downloaded
the same photo from the internet so it has the same name as before ), it won't download it nor delete it again and it will tell you which file.
# If you move the run.bat file in other directory than the Python script is, it won't work. Please keep them togheder at all times !
# There are some other functionalities I have in mind for this script, but I'm working on other projects so maybe in the future it will get an update :D !
